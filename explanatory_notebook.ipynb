These horses were identified by having letter in the finish position. This way, non-finishers were assigned last place + 1 to differentiate from those actually finishing the race. The performance score is calculated as the reciprocal of the updated 'FinishPosition' and then normalized within each 'RaceID' to ensure comparability\n","\n","4. Features on horses, trainers, and jockeys past participations\n","\n","**add details**\n","\n","- Consistency of Horse's Finish Position\n","  - Rationale: A horse that consistently finishes in top positions is likely to have better training, conditioning, and inherent ability, making it a strong contender in future races.\n","  - Model Impact: By quantifying finish position consistency the model can better assess the reliability of a horse's performance. This feature can help distinguish consistently good performers from horses that might have had a few random wins.\n","  - Method: We created 2 new variables: 'horse_consistency_position' takes the standard deviation of the horse's last five finish position. 'horse_consistency' takes the standard devaition of the horse's last five normalized score.\n","\n","- Average Beaten Margin\n","  - Rationale: The average margin by which a horse is beaten in races can provide insights into how competitive the horse is, even when it does not win. A smaller beaten margin could indicate that the horse is often a strong competitor but may have faced some minor issues preventing a win.\n","  - Model Impact: This feature helps to differentiate between horses that barely lose and those that are often non-competitive. In close races, horses with a history of smaller beaten margins might be given more favorable odds by the model. This gives us additional information in determining the horse's win probability than only looking at their past finish position.\n","\n","- Field Competitiveness\n","  - Rationale: The level of competition in previous races can be a significant factor in interpreting a horse's past performance. Winning a high-stakes race with strong competitors can be more indicative of a horse's ability than winning among a weak field.\n","  - Model Impact: By incorporating measures of field competitiveness the model can weigh a horse's past wins or places more accurately.\n","  - Method: We calculated this variable using the 'horse_past_perf_score', 'jockey_past_perf_score', 'trainer_past_perf_score', and 'race_prizemoney_score'. After assigning different weight to these variable, we multiple these variables with the weight and sum them up. We then group the dataset by RaceID and get the average of this score for each race as the 'field_competitiveness'.\n","\n"," **'composite_past_perf_score' -> derived as we're calculating for the field competitiveness -> are we keeping it? as I believe it was the top feature for some of the models**\n","\n","- Dam and Sire Past Performance Score\n","  - Rationale: Pedigree information can be an important indicator of latent potential and performance capacity. A horse's dam (mother) and sire (father) can provide insights into the genetic quality and inherited traits that may influence a horse's capabilities.\n","  - Model Impact: By quantifying the average performance of siblings from the same dam, we can adjust predictions to account for genetic factors that may not be immediately observable, potentially improving the accuracy of the model when assessing a horse's prospects.\n","  - Method: We calculated the 'Dam Performance Score' by taking the average of horse_averagescore_scaled for all offspring of the same dam. This score is then assigned to each horse as an inherited performance metric. We did the same for 'Sire_performance_score'\n","\n","- Age and Race Prize Money Interaction Term\n","  - Rationale: The interaction between a horse's age and the prize money of a race could signal the maturity and experience of a horse relative to the level of competition it has faced\n","  - Model Impact: This interaction term can help the model to discern whether a horse is in its prime and competing successfully in higher-stakes races, which is often a strong predictor of future performance.\n","  - Method: We created the interaction term by multiplying the 'HorseAge' variable with 'RacePrizemoney', enabling the model to assess the combined effect of these variables on race outcomes.\n","\n","\n","- Combined Performance Score (Horse * Jockey * Trainer)\n","  - Rationale: Combining the past performance score of horse, jockey, and trainer can give us a fuller picture of how a horse's performance.\n","  - Model Impact: A combined performance score can quantify this synergy of the three parties, offering a holistic view of the team behind a horse, and may correlate strongly with winning outcomes.\n","  - Method: We compute 3 'Combined Performance Score' by multiplying the win rates, average scores, and last 5 race scores of the horse, jockey, and trainer. This composite score is designed to capture the cumulative effect of each contributor's recent performance.\n","\n","- Rest Period\n","  - Rationale: The duration of a horse's rest period before a race can greatly affect its performance. Both extended rest and quick turnarounds have implications for a horse's readiness and physical condition.\n","  - Model Impact: Including the 'Rest Period' as a variable helps to ensure that the model accounts for potential effects of fatigue or well-restedness, which can be particularly influential in a horse's race day performance.\n","  - Method: The 'Rest Period' is calculated as the number of days since a horse's last race. This period is considered in the context of each horse's historical performance trends post-rest to evaluate its potential impact on the upcoming race.\n","\n","\n","etc. -> in this section, we can go through all engineered features that we end up using in the final model and briefly explain what they mean and how we get them"],"metadata":{"id":"IqsmFwssD8yW"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## **4.
