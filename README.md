# CANSSI-FrenchTrot
Cynthia &amp; Juliette's submission to the CANSSI French Trot Horse Racing Forecasting Competition


An entry consists of 
- an end-to-end reproducible model that the judges can run themselves (after they add the data);
- an explanatory notebook talking about your submission; and
- forecasts for the three-month holdout test period. For every observation, please create a variable winprobability, which is what you are trying to predict. As a reminder, by RaceID this winprobability should sum to 1.0
